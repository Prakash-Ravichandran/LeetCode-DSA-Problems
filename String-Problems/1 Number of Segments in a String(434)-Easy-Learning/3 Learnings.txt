1. Thought of solving the problems using .split() function
2. Then approached by solving using array of regex -> .split("[, \\s]")

Path to solution:

1. \\s+ is the specific regex to catch all words in a sentence(string) 
2. + a regex means more than once 
3. \\s a regex means whitespace characters


Tried:

1. \\s, \s, "[, \\s ']+"
