Approach 1: Two Pointers
Intuition

Since this question is asking us to remove all elements of the given value in-place, we have to handle it with O(1)O(1)O(1) extra space. How to solve it? We can keep two pointers iii and jjj, where iii is the slow-runner while jjj is the fast-runner.

Algorithm

When nums[j]nums[j]nums[j] equals to the given value, skip this element by incrementing jjj. As long as nums[j]≠valnums[j] \neq valnums[j]

=val, we copy nums[j]nums[j]nums[j] to nums[i]nums[i]nums[i] and increment both indexes at the same time. Repeat the process until jjj reaches the end of the array and the new length is iii.
